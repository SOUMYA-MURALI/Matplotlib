The fictional ride sharing company "Pyber" has a presence in Urban, Suburban and Rural areas; however, the market share in each region is unequal. The Pyber data contains information on drivers and rides, including additional details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.We have created a bubble plot and some pie charts using matplotlib library for analyzing the data and to find out the observable trends.
